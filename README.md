# CZ4034-Information-Retrieval
For our CZ4034 Information Retrieval Course Assignment, our team is required to build an information retrieval system for sentiment analysis. In particular, we will have to crawl a text corpus based on a topic of our interest, build a search engine to query over the corpus, and finally perform sentiment analysis over it. The system can be about any domain and data of our preference. For example, an information retrieval system for social media marketing, political forecasting, healthcare, financial forecasting, or a recommendation system.
