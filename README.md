# CZ4034-Information Retrieval

For our CZ4034 Information Retrieval Course Assignment, our team is required to build an information retrieval system for sentiment analysis. In particular, we will have to crawl a text corpus based on a topic of our interest, build a search engine to query over the corpus, and finally perform sentiment analysis over it. The system can be about any domain and data of our preference. For example, an information retrieval system for social media marketing, political forecasting, healthcare, financial forecasting, or a recommendation system.

This repository contains the work done by CZ4034-Information Retrieval Team 11 for the course project. The detailed explanation 
on how to compile and run the source codes are found in the README files in the subfolders of each of the sub-questions for the project.

The 3 README files for each of the sub-questions are found in sub-folders:

- backend
- frontend
- sentiment_analysis
