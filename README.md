# CZ4034-Information Retrieval

For our CZ4034 Information Retrieval Course Assignment, our team is required to build an information retrieval system for sentiment analysis. In particular, we will have to crawl a text corpus based on a topic of our interest, build a search engine to query over the corpus, and finally perform sentiment analysis over it. The system can be about any domain and data of our preference. For example, an information retrieval system for social media marketing, political forecasting, healthcare, financial forecasting, or a recommendation system.

Team members who contributed to the success of the project:

1. Trinh Tuan Dung
2. Nguyen Doan Hoang Lam
3. Gabriella Benedicta Christianti
4. Stephanie Audrey Susanto
5. Le Tan Khang
6. Shearman Chua Wei Jie

This repository contains the work done by CZ4034-Information Retrieval Team 11 for the course project. The detailed explanation 
on how to compile and run the source codes are found in the README files in the subfolders of each of the sub-questions for the project.

The 3 README files for each of the sub-questions are found in sub-folders:

- backend
- frontend
- sentiment_analysis

## Problem Statement
The use of social media platforms such as Twitter has enabled us to be able to freely express our thoughts and ideas online, as well as hyper target, and mass promote content and personal brand around the world. However, the rights of free speech, as well as the ease of posting comments on Twitter gave rise to negative online behaviors, like toxic comments (i.e., comments that are rude, disrespectful, or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion). The threat of abuse and harassment online means that many people stop expressing themselves and give up on seeking different opinions. Platforms struggle to effectively facilitate conversations, leading many communities to limit or completely shut down user comments.
Therefore, there is a need for tools to detect the presence of negative online behaviors, as well as toxic comments in order to be able to shut down negative online behaviors and toxic comments from social media platforms.
The objective of our team’s project is to build an information retrieval system that is able to allow us to query tweets crawled from Twitter, perform sentiment analysis over them using various classification models, and thereafter display the data in a way that will allow us to analyze the presence of toxic comments, their origins as well as their various metadata compositions.

The files in side the zipped folder are as follows:
- automatic_classification_labeled_tweets (text classified by our classification model)
- crawled_text_corpus_data (all the crawled text data from Twitter for our group’s Information Retrieval System)
- manually_classified_training_data (manually annotated text data to be used for training the classification model)
- manually_classified_validation_dataset (manually annotated text data as the evaluation dataset manually by labeling 10% of the collected data)
- preprocessed_kaggle_data_for_question4 (additional preprocessed data from Kaggle to be used for training the classification model)
- queries-and-results (queries and their results)
